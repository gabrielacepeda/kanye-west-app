## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

By utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB, I created a simple list app where you can input and delete list items. Upon refreshing the page, the list items remain unless deleted. There is also a Kanye West playlist that plays 'The Life of Pablo' album.

## Optimizations

This app works and saves list item entries in the database.

## Lessons Learned:

Relying on JavaScript to do CSS was new to me, but also allowed this app to work more efficiently. Now I can apply this knowledge to future applications.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `npm run savage`
2. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
